 This script was used to answer question 10 
A palindromic number reads the same both ways.
                 The largest palindrome made from the
                   product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 Ã— 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

Save the result in the file 102-result
Your file should contain the exact
             result, no new line, no extra space
